# ðŸªŸ Windows VM Setup in VirtualBox

This project documents the step-by-step process I followed to install and configure a **Windows virtual machine** using **Oracle VirtualBox**. It includes screenshots, detailed steps, and troubleshooting notes based on real setup issues I encountered and resolved.

---

## Project Goals

- Install and run Windows 11 in a VirtualBox VM
- Gain hands-on experience with virtualization
- Understand hardware virtualization settings, boot sequences, and ISO handling
- Create a reusable reference for future VM setups

| `steps/`            | Step-by-step breakdown of the entire setup process      |
| `images/`           | Screenshots captured during the VM setup                |
| `NOTES.md`          | Troubleshooting notes, lessons learned, and summary     |
| `README.md`         | This file                                               |

## Setup Process

You'll find all the stages of the setup inside the `steps/` folder. Key stages include:

1. Downloading Windows ISO  
2. Creating a new VM  
3. Mounting ISO & configuring VM settings  
4. Boot order setup  
5. Installing Guest Additions  
6. Final tuning & testing

Each file in the `steps/` folder is self-contained with images and clear instructions.

## Common Issues

Check out `NOTES.md` for real-world troubleshooting, including:

- ISO not detected during boot  
- Boot order misconfiguration  
- TPM and EFI settings for Windows 11  
- Live CD/DVD checkbox importance  
- Performance tips (CPU, VT-x, etc.)

## Reflection

Setting up this VM took longer than expected, I hit a few snags with ISO mounting and startup failures. These issues forced me to dive deeper into VirtualBoxâ€™s settings (like Live CD, controller types, and boot priority), which in the end helped me build a much clearer understanding of virtual machine configuration. Now I feel much more confident spinning up VMs quickly and effectively.
